EasyStorageSample
=================

Quick little game to show how to use the EasyStorage library.

Currently tested to work on Windows and Ouya.  Other platforms supported by XNA and MonoGame would be easy to implement.

Note: This lib uses a couple of submodules, so make sure to run "git submodule init; git submodule update" after cloning.
